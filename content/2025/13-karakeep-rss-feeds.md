Hello there!

I've been using `RSS` for years. Initially, it was `Google RSS Reader` and a couple of subscriptions. Just a couple of new posts per day. I was able to manage them manually, read interesting ones, and skip everything else. The number of subscriptions started to grow, so I needed a way to go through all posts, filter them, and save them for later reading.

`Pocket` was the solution I had been using for a long time. It was a nice service to save articles to read them later. If you don't have an internet connection, open a saved version. The saved version wasn't perfect; sometimes `Pocket` wasn't able to generate it at all, sometimes some paragraphs were missing, or formatting was wrong. So I preferred the online version, anyway, the internet connection is available 99% of the time. But overall, the service was good.

I don't remember the reason why, but I decided to delete the `Pocket` account. As a temporary solution, I saved all existing links to a browser's reading list. I started to explore self-hosted solutions and later migrated to `Karakeep`. It has a lot of cool features, but I've been using it the same way as `Pocket`. Open a RSS reader, save a link, add some tags, and read it later. Pretty simple. Yeah, I know it has an integration with search intexer or AI for auto-tagging and some other fancy stuff. I don't need them, after years of using `Pocket`, I learned a single lesson - I never search in read posts, and I don't use `Pocket` as a personal knowledge base.

Recently, I discovered a feature that can simplify the "Open a RSS reader, save a link, add some tags, read it later" flow. It completely changed how I use Karakeep. It is hidden in `User Settings` and called `RSS Subscriptions` and allows for automatically fetch new posts from blogs, parse tags, and save them into `Karakeep`. It combined two services into one.

Automation is great, but only when the signal-to-noise ratio is under control. This feature might be a problem if you have a lot of subscriptions or active blogs. In this case, it would save a lot of unnecessary posts. It is not a problem for me because I deleted a lot of "spammy" subscriptions and left only the necessary ones. So, `Karakeep` would save 1-2 posts per day on average.

This setup works well if you read a few high-quality blogs regularly and don’t need a long-term knowledge archive.
